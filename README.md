## Prompt

### Task:
For the technical interview, I’d like you to create something that helps me see how you approach problems, what tools you use, your code style, your design sense, etc.
### Background:
We’re currently running a 15-day test program for kids and parents where the parent receives a daily link via SMS. The link takes them to their personalized daily activity. Each activity contains an embedded video and text that explains the activity. Then a form where the parent and kid can provide their answers. Common forms of input include: short text, long text, recorded audio, recorded video and multiple choice questions.

### Objective:
Build and deploy a form that represents an instance of what I described above.

### Spec:
This is intentionally open ended, I’m hoping for some creativity in the approach (i.e. unless something is explicitly stated, set your own constraints)
The contents form should be placeholder
You can use whatever tools/libs/ui kits/etc you want
It should be deployed (anywhere you like) and committed to a repo so I can see the code
Feel free to shoot over any questions.
